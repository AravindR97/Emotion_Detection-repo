# Emotion Detection: AI Web App
## Scenario
You have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.

## Description
Emotion detection involves the process extracting the finer emotions: joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on. For this project, I used the Emotion Predict function of IBM's Watson AI Natural Language Processing Library.

The following tasks were done as part of this project:
  1. Created an Emotion Detection application using the functions from embeddable AI libraries.
  2. Extracted relevant information from the output received from the function.
  3. Tested and packaged the application created using the Emotion Detection function..
  4. Completed web deployment of the application using Flask.
  5. Incorporated error handling in the application to account for invalid input to the application.
  6. Written codes that are in perfect compliance with PEP8 guidelines, getting 10/10 score in static code analysis.
